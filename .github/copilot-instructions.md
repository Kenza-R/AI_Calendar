# GitHub Copilot Instructions for AI_Calendar

## Project Overview
AI_Calendar is a calendar application powered by artificial intelligence. This project aims to provide intelligent scheduling and calendar management features.

## Code Style and Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- Prioritize readability and clarity over cleverness
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Documentation
- Add clear comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep README.md up to date with project changes
- Include usage examples where appropriate

### Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure tests are clear and maintainable
- Aim for good test coverage of critical paths
- Run all tests before submitting changes

### Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Understand the existing code structure
2. Check for related issues or discussions
3. Consider the impact on existing functionality

### When Implementing Features
1. Start with minimal, focused changes
2. Test incrementally as you develop
3. Update documentation alongside code changes
4. Consider edge cases and error handling

### Code Review Considerations
- Ensure code is self-explanatory or well-commented
- Verify that changes don't introduce breaking changes
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Validate that tests pass and code is properly formatted

## AI-Specific Considerations
- When working with AI/ML features, document model choices and parameters
- Consider data privacy and security implications
- Optimize for performance where AI operations may be resource-intensive
- Handle AI service failures gracefully

## Project Structure
- Follow the established directory structure
- Keep related files organized together
- Separate concerns appropriately (UI, business logic, data access, etc.)

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Document why new dependencies are needed
- Keep dependencies up to date for security
- Check for compatible licenses

## Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Write code that is easy to test
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- Consider accessibility in user-facing features
- Optimize for maintainability over premature optimization
